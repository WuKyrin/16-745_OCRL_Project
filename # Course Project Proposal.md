## Project Description

# Challenges:
1. Dynamic Programming for Autonomous Decision Making
   The KUKA arm would need to make autonomous decisions based on the visual data it receives. __Dynamic programming__ and __iterative LQR methods__ could be employed to decide the best course of action in a step-by-step fashion during the surgery.
2. Trajectory Optimization for Arm
   How to realize the complex constrained motion planning. DDP
3. Real-Time Adaptation and Learning
   Reinforcement learning from an __optimal control perspective__(Week 11) can be pivotal. How should we formulate the problem in a way that allows the robot to make real-time adjustments based on visual feedback.
4. Optimizing Vision-Based Registration
   How to combine image processing and sensor fusion that could benefit from __convex optimization techniques__ (Week 5) to ensure the registration is as accurate as possible.
